# Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization

Code of the paper "Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization".

## Abstract


## Code
lr.m is the implementation of the logistic regression and corresponding attack on MATLAB.

dnn is the implementation of decentralized federated learning via PDMM and gradient inversion attack on Python.

## Requirement
### Logistic Regression
```
Matlab
```

### DNN
```
pytorch
```

## Note
Part of code in gradient inversion attack is based on
